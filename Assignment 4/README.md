Place this text into the Maya Script Editor, and it will create a folder for the incremented 
saves, as well as create a new Maya file with an incremented save on it. This file takes the 
name of the Maya file and creates a directory that the files will be saved into so that it does 
not clutter the folder in which the file is saved.
