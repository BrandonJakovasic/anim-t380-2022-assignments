This code has 3 different funtions broken into 2 different scripts

-The first code creates a file named asset.alias in the etc folder by using an 
alias for a environment variable

-In the same file a new file directory that goes as follows
assets/$asset/maya/scenes

-The other file opens maya and creates a null group then alters the name based of the name in
the asset.alias file. Then maya saves and closes
